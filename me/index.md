I’m currently a conservator at the Kramlich Collection, one of the world’s largest private collections of video and media art. I’ve previously worked at Anthology Film Archives, a center for the preservation, study, and exhibition of experimental film and video, and DuArt Restoration, a post-production facility working with leading museums, libraries and archives to preserve moving image and recorded sound heritage. I also teach Video Preservation as an an Adjunct Professor at New York University.
